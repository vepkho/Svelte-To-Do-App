# Kookla - To-Do-App

This is a simple **SvelteJS** application.

## Experience

That was the first time I used **SvelteJS** to create a web application. To speak my mind, for the first time, I was confused by its syntax, but in the end, I found it simple and practical. 

Unlike **ReactJS**, you do not need any _state management tool_(Redux, Redux Toolkit, Zustand) as it has built-in functions for that.
